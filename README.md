# Prime

It's a simple console application that prints the multiplication table of user-input, n, prime numbers.

Test cases are included in Prime.Tests project. I have used nunit framework and TestDriven.Net add-on for MS Visual Studio.

The tests can be run from the Test Explorer.
Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer
